> ● If fewer than 12 cells are populated in a group, unused cell taps must all be connected to the highest
potential cell in that group. For example, if 6 cells are populated in a group, taps 6 – 12 all must be
connected to the positive tap on cell 6.*

> ● No cell group may have fewer than 4 cells connected (higher minimums may apply if a cell's
minimum voltage is below 2.8v). If a group of cells ends up with fewer than 4 cells, some cells must
be skipped in one of the other groups and wired into the group with less than 4 to ensure that a
minimum of 4 cells are present.

> ● Cell Groups must have a minimum normal working voltage of 11 volts (2.8v per cell for 4 cells) and
an absolute minimum voltage of 10v. Accuracy of voltage measurements is decreased when the
group voltage is below 11 volts.

> ● If a cell group has 0 cells connected (the group is skipped entirely), all wires from that group may be
left disconnected.
