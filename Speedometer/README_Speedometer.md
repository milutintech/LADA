# Introduction 
During fermentation in wine production, heat is generated as a result of the chemical processes. To cool these fermentation tanks, glycol is pumped through cooling fins to control the tank temperature.
The development of this product was requested by Weingut Obrecht AG and carried out by MILUTIN.

# Getting Started 
Clone this Repo to your machine, now you are able to use all data from the Tankk√ºhlung.  

# Device
The tank cooling system is characterized by the fact that it has 3 relay outputs, so for example a solenoid or servo valve can be controlled with 2 of the 3 relays. Additional functionality can be implemented using the 3rd relay. A Neopixel output is attached to the device for the display and an input for the temperature sensor is implemented.
